CrystalArchiver is a one click mass archiver for PSM licenses that does not require launching each PSM game. This project was created for the PSM Yaroze project which aims to save not only PSM history, but Sony and indie developer history. 

Each license is backed up by calling the original DRM functions used by the  original PSM Application and then creating a depersonalized key in FAKE.RIF format used by NoPSMDRM. A depersonalized key allows a backup to be decrypted and to be played without PSM activation, provided you have the original PSM files. Because it is not tied to any one user, it does not contain personalized information. 

This can allow you play your PSM titles on another Vita you may own, even if you did not activate or download them before PSM closure. You can even play it on a Windows PC. Please note that this tool is used for creating backups and we would like you not to use it for anything that may hurt developers. Many PSM titles were ported to other systems where you can continue to support them.

After running CrystalArchiver, these license backups will be found at ux0:/data/psm

It also can auto-contribute via network to PSM Yaroze, PSM archival project, you can read about it here:

PSM Yaroze is the first serious PSM archival effort and take preservation of history very seriously. When contributing, we do not collect any personal information. Like many proper archival efforts, we also do not distribute your contributed content and do not condone piracy. What we collect is a depersonalized key that cannot be traced back to you, we then use this key to store a decrypted copy of the title in which it belongs to. This decrypted copy is kept only by the PSM Yaroze Archival Team and is used to provide the public with information such as screenshots, footage, and other information that we are permitted to release. The local backup on your device will be created regardless of your choice if or not to contribute to PSM Yaroze. 

We strongly consider you to contribute to PSM Yaroze, there is no use hoarding these games and by doing so you are hurting everyone by endangering history. This information will be lost forever if your Vita somehow breaks. It will be your fault.
